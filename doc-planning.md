# Plan Your Documentation

Whether you are working on a large or small project, documentation is the first and last step. 

## Create a Game plan

Define the scope of work. What is being documented and what value will this documentation bring to the users and the company. If you are working on reference documentation, list out the overview and requirements of the product. 

Ask your self who will be involved in the process. Will you need to interview SME's such as engineers? You will need to investigate and tinker with the product to gather information. 

Once you gathered prelimainary data, outline your documentation. It can be a simple or detailed outline.
