# Git for Content Creators

Content creators need storage to save their work. I am a technical writer who creates content on Medium and need a place to store my blog writing,

For a very long time, I left my blog posts on Medium however, I had a difficult time retrieving  and tracking past changes. 

In this blog post, I will demonstrate how to use git for content creators.

## Set up a GitHub Account

The first step is to create a GitHub account. You can use third-party sign-on (OAuth).

GitHub provides sign-up instructions for beginners.

## Create a Repository for your writing projects

Repositories are similar to folders on your computer. You can name your repositories medium-blog-posts or something similar.

Once you create a repository, you can start adding your blog files. I recommend using .md files because markdown has a similar structure to blog posts.


## Add a file

Let's add your file. You can use the web interface. 

Click the add a new file button in your repository. 

Choose the file type and start editing your work in the browser.

## Edit File

Click the edit file button to start editing your files.

You can copy-paste your blog posts from Medium and format accordingly. accordingly.

## Save changes

Once you are done editing your work, click the "Commit changes" button.

Add your commit message and descriptions and commit changes.

## In Conclusion

Now, you can track any changes and updates to your blog posts. You can have multiple repositories in your GitHub account. In the past, I used GitHub only for coding projects but now, I use it to track all my work. It can git very addicting once you get the hang of it.Â 
You will see all shades of green to track your contributions.

Happy writing!
