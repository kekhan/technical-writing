# Git for Content Creators

Content creators need storage to save their work. I am a technical writer who creates contnent on Medium and need a place to store my blog writing,

For a very long time, I left my blog posts on Medium however, I had a difficult time retrieving  and tracking past changes. 

In this blog post, I will demonstrate how to use git for content creators.

## Set up GitHub Account

The first step is to create a github account. You can use third party sign on (OAuth).

Github provides sign-up instruction for beginners.

## Create a Repository for your writing projects

Repositories are similar to folders on your computer. You can name your reposities medium-blog-posts or something similar.

Once you create a repository, you can start adding your blog files. I recommend using .md files bexuase mark down has similar structute to blog posts.
